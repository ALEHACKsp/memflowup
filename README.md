# memflow connector setup script

Requires Python.

This script is meant to provide a really quick way to setup various memflow connectors. Currently, it only supports installing connectors, and lacks features such as kernel module support, but it is to be expanded upon.

Run `curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memflow/memflowup/master/memflowup.py | python3` for interactive installation.
